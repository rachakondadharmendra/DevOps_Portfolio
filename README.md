**DevOps Engineer Portfolio**

This is a basic responsive portfolio website for a DevOps Engineer. 

**Features:**

* **Navigation bar:** Links to different sections of the website (Home, About, Projects, Contact).
* **Info section:** Introduces the developer with a short bio and social media links.
* **Tech stack:** Displays the technologies the developer is proficient in using icons.
* **Projects section:** Showcases a few projects with a brief description and a link to learn more.
* **Contact form:** Allows visitors to contact the developer.

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```
npm start
```

The website will be available at http://localhost:3000.

**Customization**

* Replace the placeholder content in the HTML file with your own information, including:
    * Your name and bio in the About section
    * Descriptions and links for your projects
    * Your social media links
* You can also customize the styles in the CSS file to match your preferences.

**Note:**

* The contact form is a simple example and does not actually send emails. You will need to implement your own email sending functionality if you want visitors to be able to contact you through the form.
